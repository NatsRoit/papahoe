# PAPAHOE SURFSHOP: Fullstack DEV Final Project
Fictional Brand specialized on surfboards and other surf items.

Papa Hoe was born as a small artisan atelier specialized in the production of high quality surfboards.
Today, through its new e-commerce site, PapaHoe opens its doors to the world to share its philosophy and to showcase the best surfboards availible on the market!

MAIN CORE BUSINESS
PapaHoe's core business comprises surfboards, be they stock models created by PapaHoe's shapers as well as custom-made surfboards. Other complementary products are also offered on the site.
Another important aspect to consider for the design and development of the website was the importance to be given to the Brand's Philosophy and Identity, as the website's launching is meant to also be the Brand's launching.

TARGET AUDIENCE
Younger people and adults who are interested in surfing as a lifestyle or as a professionally oriented sport. We divide our target audience into two main groups:
    - WAVE RIDERS: professional athletes, or amateurs;
    - SEA LOVERS: general public, amateurs.
